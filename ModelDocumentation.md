A walkthrough was given by Udacity for linear and circular paths to help get started on the project.

The path planner has to solve the remaining issues
1. Drive at least 4.32 miles without incident
2. Drive according to the speed limit
3. The car does not exceed a total acceleration of 10 m/s^2 and a jerk of 10 m/s^3.
4. No collisions
5. Change lane ability
6. The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
